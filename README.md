# Malicious-URL-s-Detection-Based-on-Machine-Learning
Designed and implemented a system to automatically identify and classify malicious URLs leveraging machine learning techniques. The project involved collecting and preprocessing URL datasets, extracting meaningful 
features (such as lexical patterns, domain information, and statistical attributes), and training multiple ML models for classification. Among the tested algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost provided the highest 
accuracy. The system was further deployed as a Streamlit-based web application, enabling end-users to input URLs and instantly receive predictions along with interpretabilityÂ insights.
